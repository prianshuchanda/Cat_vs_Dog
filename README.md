Cat vs Dog Image Classification using CNN



________________________________________
📝 Project Description





This project aims to build a binary image classifier using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. It’s a practical deep learning implementation using TensorFlow and Keras, performed in a Google Colab environment.
Through training on a labeled dataset, the CNN learns visual features such as shapes, textures, and patterns to predict whether an image contains a dog or a cat. This project showcases key steps in computer vision and deep learning workflows.
